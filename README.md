# SQL FOR PLACEMENTS

<img src = "https://assets.leetcode.com/static_assets/others/Top_SQL_50.png" height = '200px' width = '200px'>

This repository includes the SQL problems I solve during my Placements Preparation. 

There will be two folders
<ol>
  <li> <b>Practice</b> </li>
  <li> <b>SQL 50 (From Leetcode)</b> </li>
</ol>

Each file has the problem statement and the solution in SQL Language. Hope this is useful !!
